## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide specific details of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter different criteria at the same time. By filtering through the Date, City, State, Country and Shape of UFO sightings, the user experience becomes more interactive and accurate, while providing the most important details of the subject matter in an organized and engaging format.

## Results
### Description of the webpage

The search criteria established on the UFO Sightings page has five search category criteria, therefore allowing a speedy and precise search of the results provided by the original data. These categories are the **Date, City, State, Country** and **Shape** regarding the information provided on the UFO Sightings webpage. By filtering through any given criteria, the search results will return all available possibilities:

As seen above, *"fireball"* was entered in the category **"Shape"**, which then returned all the results where the shape of the UFO Sightings was identified as a *"fireball"*.

By entering another search component such as *"fl"* for the **"State"** of the UFO Sightings, the search results are further refined to provide the following results:

This function allows the user to facilitate, simplify and ameliorate their experience on the UFO Sightings website. 

## Summary of the Analysis
### Drawbacks of the Webpage Design

Overall, the UFO Sightings website provides a more efficient way to find and categorize the data and information about the subject matter provided. However, the only results provided on the website are for the month of January 2010. The functionality of the webpage therefore does not take into consideration previous or following years as well as current UFO sightings. This is a significant drawback, as it does not allow users to expand their search, while limiting the results and information available on the webpage. Another disadvantage would be the current dark mode or night viewer of the webpage. There are users that might find this layout uncomfortable, and the option to change it to a light mode is not available.

### Recommendations

There are a few recommendations that can be made to improve the functionality of the website as well as the user experience. Adding other elements in the Filter Search Table such as the **"Duration"** and **"Key Words"** from the comment section, would provide a more specific, interactive, and efficient user experience. Furthermore, the addition of past, current and updated data would allow users to have access to more pertinent data information. Finally, the incorporation of a light mode viewer option would enable users to choose different settings that are deemed more suitable and therefore contribute to a better user experience.
